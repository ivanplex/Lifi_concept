abstract = {Optical fiber communication networks can provide terabit aggregate capacities to buildings and offices within modern cities. Practical wireless systems are orders of magnitude below this capacity. In this letter, we describe an indoor optical bidirectional wireless link with an aggregate capacity over 100 Gb/s. The link operates over {\~{}}3 m range at 224 Gb/s (6 x 37.4 Gb/s) and 112 Gb/s (3 x 37.4 Gb/s) with a wide field of view (FOV) of 60° and 36°, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a wireless link of this type with a FOV that offers practical room-scale coverage.},

@book{Clark1981,
abstract = {Error-correction coding is being used on an almost routine basis in most new communication systems. Not only is coding equipment being used to increase the energy efficiency of communication links, but coding ideas are also providing innovative solutions to many related communication problems. Among these are the elimination of intersymbol interference caused by filtering and multipath and the improved demodulation of certain frequency modulated signals by taking advantage of the "natural" coding provided by a continuous phase. Although several books and nu merous articles have been written on coding theory, there are still noticeable deficiencies. First, the practical aspects of translating a specific decoding algorithm into actual hardware have been largely ignored. The information that is available is sketchy and is widely dispersed. Second, the information required to evaluate a particular technique under situations that are en countered in practice is available for the most part only in private company reports. This book is aimed at correcting both of these problems. It is written for the design engineer who must build the coding and decoding equipment and for the communication system engineer who must incorporate this equipment into a system. It is also suitable as a senior-level or first-year graduate text for an introductory one-semester course in coding theory. The book U"Ses a minimum of mathematics and entirely avoids the classical theorem/proof approach that is often seen in coding texts.},

abstract = {Error-correcting codes constitute one of the key ingredients in achieving the high degree of reliability required in modern data transmission and storage systems. This book introduces the reader to the theoretical foundations of error-correcting codes, with an emphasis on Reed-Solomon codes and their derivative codes. After reviewing linear codes and finite fields, Ron Roth describes Reed-Solomon codes and various decoding algorithms. Cyclic codes are presented, as are MDS codes, graph codes, and codes in the Lee metric. Concatenated, trellis, and convolutional codes are also discussed in detail.},
